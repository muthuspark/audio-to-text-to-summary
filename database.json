What exactly is the problem with Kailash? The problem with opportunities is the problem. In some cases, there is a mismatch between what they studied and what the marketplace wants. This is a chronic issue. When I was in the Ministry of Education, we actually looked at some studies that have been conducted by business organizations. FICCI and ASOCHAM, I remember, had both done studies asking employers about the people they were recruiting. And there was a widespread dissatisfaction. I think the FICCI study had not been one of those two studies, said 82% of the employers were dissatisfied. This is a nationwide study, not just Kerala, dissatisfied with the quality of the graduates whom they were recruiting.", "summary": "Here is a long summary of the transcript:\n\nThe speaker starts by discussing the issue of people wanting both business and property despite pursuing an education. They highlight that the problem lies in the mismatch between what students have studied and what the market demands. This is not just a one-off issue, but rather a chronic problem that has been observed across various studies. The speaker shares their experience working in the Ministry of Education, where they looked at research conducted by business organizations such as FICCI (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry) and ASOCHAM (Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India). These studies asked employers about the job seekers they were recruiting, and the results showed widespread dissatisfaction among employers regarding the quality of graduates. Specifically, the FICCI study found that 82% of employers were dissatisfied with the quality of graduates they were recruiting. This issue is not limited to a specific region but rather affects the entire country, including Kerala.\n\nIn essence, the speaker is highlighting the gap between what students are taught and what the market demands, leading to dissatisfaction among employers when trying to recruit new employees."}, "22": {"recording_name": "Recording - 11:05:2024 16:31:15", "audio_file_name":

How do we build a system where education works hand in hand with the industry\nSPEAKER_00: and not\nSPEAKER_01: you\nSPEAKER_01: individually. Again, we thought about this problem. We got Mr. Narayanamurthy to do a study on academia-industry interface. And I have to tell you, he wrote a very good report that sadly, soon after we lost and left, has been more or less shelved by the government. And I think it's a mistake. They should have... I mean, not everything the UPA government did needs to have been disavowed by the NDA. And one day when we take over from the NDA, we will not disavow any\nSPEAKER_00: are going to\nSPEAKER_01: that Mr. Rana Murthy made some very valid points. One of the things that struck me, having spent a large number of years in the US, was how common it was in the US that a company, when it came up with an idea, would go to a nearby campus and say, guys, have you got any graduate students or doctoral students who can research this for us? If they can make this idea viable and figure out a way of how it could be manufactured, we will, first of all give you all the money for their research and we pay their stipends and so on. And then if a product is makeable and we make it, we'll share the royalties with you. And so it's a win-win for the university, for the students and for the company. They don't have to hire people on spec as it were. The students get a practical work opportunity, which may or may not work out for them, but if it works out, fantastic\nSPEAKER_00: uh\nSPEAKER_01: If it works out, there's benefits on both sides. And there's a direct connection between a real functioning industry and an academic establishment. Now, this is very common. This is how Silicon Valley was built. This is how the Raleigh-Durham Triangle in North Carolina came into being. In India, it's practically unknown. And I made speeches in those days as minister encouraging more of this to happen in our country. And I think the government's job is to create an enabling environment. We should create a framework. I mean, I say we, we're not yet in government, though we hope to be at the end of this election. But the government of India should create an enabling framework that facilitates, makes it possible, maybe even gives incentives for this kind of thing to happen. It's startling, for example, that in most of the advanced countries, the bulk of investment and research comes from the private sector. In India, the bulk of investment and research, and it's not enough, is coming from the government sector. That shouldn't be happening. Why should the taxpayer be bearing the burden when, in fact, in every other country, the private sector is carrying the burden? In OECD countries, something like 75 percent of all research expenditure comes from the private sector. In India, it's about 80-90% from the government. Let's reverse that. Let's get more private sector money into research. Now, my figures may be slightly out of date because my in-depth data goes back to when I was in government. That's now 10 years ago. But I will say that it couldn't have improved that much from what I've seen. And it needs to improve a heck of a lot more. But the government in turn should make\nSPEAKER_00: breaks and other incentives.\nSPEAKER_00: Something like CSR, but for research, like research, research, LinkedIn sent to program. Right.\nSPEAKER_01: Thanks.\nSPEAKER_00: So do you also smoke weed?\nSPEAKER_01: A well-trained university should get extra credit for enabling this kind of thing so that they benefit and the students benefit. I'm also a big believer in university autonomy. You know, maybe a university located right next to an industry will have the freedom to do things that other universities don't. A university somewhere else might have another kind of freedom. Give them the autonomy, and eventually students will vote with their feet as well. I mean, if the university is hopeless or is not doing anything relevant, with their feet as well. I mean, if the university is hopeless or is not doing anything relevant, students will go elsewhere where they've already heard that you go to that place and they're doing cutting edge work in this field or that field or they've got to tie up with this company and that industry. People will go. And as a result, you'll see which educational system\nSPEAKER_00: grows better. Very interesting, sir. So you also mentioned ease of doing business. And here you again quoted Neeti Ayog and you said that in Kerala, it takes a minimum of 248 days to set up a business, whereas the average figure for India is 120 days. So can you give me an example as to why does it take such a long time to set up a business in Kerala? Well, first of all, I\nSPEAKER_01: And here you again quoted Neeti Ayog and you said that in Kerala, it takes a minimum of 248 days to set up a business, whereas the average figure for India is 120 days. So can you give me an example as to why does it take such a long time to set up a business in Kerala? Well, first of all, I think it's to do with the processes of government. Every file requires four or five signatures in a particular order of sequence. If one guy is on leave or sick or traveling somewhere on duty or whatever, the file just sits until he comes back and signs that file. Then it goes up the chain, the same thing happens, and so on. Totally unnecessary. I've learned this even for a simple procedure like getting approvals for a house, to build a house in Tiruvannamalai. Everything requires multiple people to be involved, multiple clearances. Why does it people to be involved, multiple clearances. Why does it need to be? I've urged that if we come to power in Kerala, we should have the entire administrative regulatory apparatus reviewed and slashed. I mean, if Singapore and America can clear a business in three days, it doesn't even need the 120 that India as an average takes. It should not need 214. Well, I think the exact numbers were 236, I think, and 238 and 126 or something like that, whatever it may be. Those numbers are unacceptable in the modern age. And it puts us at a major disadvantage with other countries. I don't know what the days required are in China, Vietnam, Malaysia and so on, but they're all very much better than us. Maybe not as good as Singapore but not at all much worse. So do you think single window clearance system is a solution to this problem? That's part of it. That's part of it. The single window must work efficiently. If you understaff a single window it becomes a logjam rather than a blessing.\nSPEAKER_00: Can you give me an example, sir? You mentioned approvals. Can you give me an example of a business owner requiring approvals and because of which...\nSPEAKER_01: You need approvals for everything. You need approvals for the business itself. You need approvals for where you're going to erect your factory or whatever. You need approvals at every stage of the process. For the equipment you're going to buy and bring in there, you'll need approvals. You'll need environmental clearances, land clearances, fire clearances, water clearances. And in each of these cases, there's multiple levels of clearance involved. It's an over-regulated system. But that's true of everything in our country. Our educational system is over-regulated too, and under-governed. Governance is about facilitating outcomes. Our country's regulation is about controlling processes. And this business of process versus outcome is something that we have to drill into the heads of our bureaucracy. Our bureaucracy exists to ensure that the process is followed. It now needs to turn around to ensure that the outcome is achieved.\nSPEAKER_00: Mm.\nSPEAKER_01: to ask even if the process is needed in the first place or not. Well, that's something that bureaucrats tend not to do because they inherit it from\nSPEAKER_01: generations of you\nSPEAKER_00: before them. That is very interesting sir. Sir, now I want to talk to you about Kerala's economic crisis. We made a video about it a month back and during that time we saw some stats and they were just very disturbing. 3.5 lakh government employees salaries were delayed. The social security schemes of 55 lakh people was put on hold and the state was asking the centre for money. The most literate state in the country, God's own country, facing an economic disaster. How did that happen? Because and I saw it coming, strangely, because in 2021, RBI actually put out a research paper where they mentioned that there are certain states in the country that are heading the Sri Lanka way and there one of those states was Kerala. So, A, how did Kerala end up in an economic disaster? B, what are the lessons that other states have to learn from Kerala? Well, I have to say, this\nSPEAKER_01: comes into the answer.", "summary": "Here is a long summary of the transcript:\n\nThe speaker discusses various topics related to India and Kerala, including the importance of taking a standpoint on issues, the need for ease of doing business, and the economic crisis in Kerala.\n\nRegarding taking a standpoint, the speaker emphasizes that it is essential to have a clear perspective on issues, rather than being wishy-washy. He argues that this approach helps individuals make informed decisions and take a proactive stance on problems.\n\nThe speaker also highlights the need for ease of doing business in India. He notes that Kerala takes an average of 248 days to set up a business, which is much longer than the national average of 120 days. He attributes this delay to unnecessary bureaucratic procedures, including multiple signatures required for each file and excessive regulatory clearances. The speaker suggests that a single window clearance system could help streamline these processes.\n\nIn discussing Kerala's economic crisis, the speaker notes that the state has faced significant challenges in recent years. These include delays in paying salaries to government employees (3.5 lakh people), putting social security schemes for 55 lakh people on hold, and seeking financial assistance from the central government. The speaker attributes this crisis to a range of factors, including over-regulation, under-governance, and poor decision-making.\n\nThe speaker also references a research paper by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that highlighted Kerala as one of the states at risk of facing an economic crisis similar to Sri Lanka's. He suggests that other states can learn from Kerala's mistakes, including the need for greater transparency in financial management, improved governance structures, and more effective decision-making processes.\n\nThroughout the conversation, the speaker emphasizes the importance of taking a proactive approach to solving problems, rather than simply reacting to them after they have arisen. He argues that this approach requires individuals to take a clear standpoint on issues, prioritize ease of doing business, and make informed decisions about governance and economic management."}, "23": {"recording_name": "Recording - LCLOO LO STO NS ISIHTDSATHC", "audio_file_name": "recordings/d8d70c79ef674a628dbe001047bd7a83.wav", "tracks": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 4200.0, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"}, {"start": 4600.0, "end": 19900.0, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"}, {"start": 20900.0, "end": 24400.0, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01"}, {"start": 24900.0, "end": 30300.0, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01"}], "transcript": "SPEAKER_00: and impactful people.
